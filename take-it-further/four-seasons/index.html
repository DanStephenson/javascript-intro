		<p>Create a webpage about a city or place in the world that has four different themes - one for each season of the year. Add text (paragraphs, lists, etc) that are appropriate for the area you've decided to create a page about and see how many of the UI/UX elements we recently explored you can use that make sense.</p>
		<p>Try to incorporate the following elements:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An image that changes based on the season selected.</li>
			<li>A title or headline that changes based on the season.</li>
			<li>Change one section of text based on the season of the year</li>
			<li>Use classes to toggle the colour schemes in the webpage</li>
