		<p>Create a webpage about a city or place in the world that has four different themes - one for each season of the year. Add text (paragraphs, lists, etc) that are appropriate for the area you've decided to create a page about and see how many of the UI/UX elements we recently explored you can use that make sense.</p>
		<p>Create a new GitHub repository for this project, and upload your files to that repository as you work. Enable GitHub pages for this project so the finished version can be viewed in the web browser.</p>
		<p>Try to incorporate the following elements:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An image that changes based on the season selected.</li>
			<li>A title or headline that changes based on the season.</li>
			<li>Use classes to toggle the colour schemes in the webpage</li>
			<li>Give the image a drop shadow</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Take It Even Further</h2>
		<p>If you've been able to implement the features above, try to go further with these enhancements:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Change the <code>alt</code> attribute for each season's image.</li>
			<li>Change one section of text based on the season of the year</li>
			<li>Change the button colours for each season</li>
			<li>Create a responsive design</li>
			<li>Add a custom Google Font</li>
			<li>Give the page a favicon</li>
		</ul>
